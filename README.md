[BuckyRoberts Django Tutorial Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&index=1&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK)


Code in the repo is commited lesson by lesson.
Code in the repo may be slightly different.
 
 ## Why I create the repo?
The Tutorial Author delete some pars of code during the lessons, so if you want to back t oprevious lesson, it is not guaranted that was not deleted recently. Commits-for each lesson might help to solve this issue.
